# NVDARemotePublic
Public repo for NVDARemote for iOS

# About
[NVDARemote](https://github.com/nvdaremote/nvdaremote) is a NVDA Remote Access addon, which will allow you to connect to another computer running the free NVDA screen reader. With NVDARemote for iOS, you can also access another computer with you iOS device.

# Requirements
- An iOS or iPadOS device running with at least iOS / iPadOS 12.4
- An external keyboard (all keystrokes from the external keyboard will be sent to the other computer)

# Solving of common problems
The app crashes or doesn't work if you want to connect to devices in you local network? Check in your device settings -> Privacy -> Local network if NVDARemote is switched on

# Known (but currently not fixable) issues
- If you use VoiceOver as speech engine, the queue doesn't work and every sentence will be interrupted if you e.g. switch to a new line
- Keyboard enter and numpad enter can not be distinguished - this is an Apple limitation and I found no way to fix it
